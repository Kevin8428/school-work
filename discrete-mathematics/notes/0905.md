# TODO
- get into BlackBoard and look at materials
- Assignments on blackboard
- study group?

# OUTLINE
- 7 assignments
- 1 midterm
- 1 final, not cumulative
    - 
- midterm after 4th topic
    - 6th or 7th week
- test can have 2 sheets of notes

# Discrete Math
- values are finite, not taken to infinity
- math for computers
- want tso learn limitations of computers
- computers are finite
- topis from many disciplins

## continuous vs discrete
- continuous is calculus, normal math
- discrete is points, interfals etc.
    - using numbers on a computer, are points. EG discrete
    - math used to understand digital computers, systems
    - collection of topics to understand computers

- need a model to find limits to computers
    - best model is touring machine
    - need theoretical model to do this

# LOGIC
- science of truth
## Propositions or Statements - same thing
- to be a statement, everything must be definitive, but can add condition
- declarative phrase, where can come to one truth value - true or false. Can't change; valid as is, or invalid as is
- eg:
"the sky is always green" - yes/false - yes is statement, value is false
"she is always on time" - no/x - not statement, because not subjective
    - value is sometimes true/false
    - who "she" is, can change
"how are you" no/x
"there is life on mars" - yes/unknown
    - "unknown" is truth value
1. "I am a liar" - always tell lie
    - yes? look into truth value
        - assume true or false, creates a paradox
FOR ANY x:
2. x > 2
    - x is subjective, not a statement
    - x could be John, Kevin etc.
3. if x > 2 then x > 1
    - statement, true
    - put condition on it
3. if x > 2 then x > 3
    - there is at least 1 value where condition is false: 2.1
    - statement, false
    - put condition on it

## paradox
- can't find a fixed value - this happens rarely in this class

## operation
operations == connectives
**connectives**:
definition: connect two statements
- conjunctions - "and", ^, *
    - returns 1 number
    - returns a new statement
    - a and b becomes c
    - need **truth table**
- disjunction - "or", down arrow, +
- negation - "not", A', - use 1 staement, unary operation - requires one operand, one sign
- conditional - "if a then b"
    - a == hypothesis and b == conclusion
    - conditional statement
Propositions: 

connectives

daily convos: combining statements
