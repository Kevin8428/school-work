# recursion
- a body of code that acts upon a deminishing dataset until a base case occurs
- iterative is more efficient/performant
- recursive can be better for things like traversing binary tree
    - more elegant, explainable
- recursive can be iterative, iterative not always can be recursive
- is data homogeneous in large and small sets? possibly good for recursion
- can perform with data getting smaller? possibly good for recursion
- maze can be good, all subsets look like larger
- 8 queens is good because want to remember previous

- loops don't result in method calls, recursion does
    - this is why performance is worse for recursion - get more info on why, something about method call places more on stack
    - any data local to method call is still there when come back, which is awesome

public void traverse (node root) {
    if (root == null) { return };
    system.ouut.println(root.getDataa());
    traverse(root.lChild)
    traverse(root.rChild)
}

## factorial
5! == 5 factorial == 5*4*3*2*1
1! == 1 is a base case
5! == 5 * 4!
4! == 4 * 3!

```
public int factorial (int n) {
    if (n == 1) { return 1} // base case
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
}
```

# tail recursion
- when absolute last thing that takes place in a method is a recurusive call

```
public int factorial (int n) {
    if (n == 1) { return 1} // base case
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
}
```

# fibianaci
```
public int fib(int n) {
    if (n == 1) || (n == 2) { return 1} // base case
    return fib(n-1) + (n-2)
}
```
- this is `destructive`, it breaks down everything into base case, then adds numbers up
- doing a loop that simply adds numbers up would be `constructive`
