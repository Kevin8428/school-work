Lambda - first steps into functional programming for Java. You can now pass a functionality as an argument. A method will now accept an interface as a type. The lambda function doesn't need to belong to a class, can be executed on demand, and can be passed like an object.

Static - This can be run before an instance of the class is instantiated. An example is the Main function in Java.

Volatile - A java keyword used to make an execution thread safe; volatile will allow a method or class to be run by multiple an application with concurrency.

Interface - An abstract type. A contract that says to become an interface (or satisfy the interface) the object must have certain method signatures. The interface can contain variables as well.

Abstract - Similar to interfaces but it's a class which contains default method implementations. If you have an abstract class A and class B extends A, an instantiation of B inside A can't run B's methods unless A specifies the same abstract method.
