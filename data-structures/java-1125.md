- loop inside of loop is not most efficient way to do something
- 3 quadratic sorts - `bubble`, `selection`, `insertion`
    - all big O n square
    - all inefficient, but easy to write

`bubble sort`
- eg nested for loop sorting once each time where smaller numbers bubble to top
6 numbers = 6^2
10 numbers = 10^2
- this is why big O n square

`selection sort`
- select biggest number
- slightly more performant, can break inner loop after swap is done

`insertion sort`
- second array, get smallest and push/pop
- replace empty with large number, often MAX_INT, can be problem if MAX_INT is actual value to be compared.

`quick sort`
- average performance: Big O n Log n ---- or best?
- worst performance: bit O n squared
- `won't need to implement for final`
- `for exam, write partition function of quick sort`

`merge sort` or recursive merge sort
- performance is always Big O n Log n
- divide into equal sized groups, build back up to top layer, do loop to compare.
    - doing compare on more sorted data make sit much more performant than quadratic
- `bring in class example of merge sort to final`

1. for two above, process is: break data down, put back together

`heap sort`
- performance is always Big O n Log n
- only rule: root must be greater than two children
- build heap and then pull off and put into array
