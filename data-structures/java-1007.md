# Stacks
- LIFO
- `push` onto stack
- `pop` off of stack
- why use?
    - processor has stacks.
    - `stack variables`, come off stack
    - HEAP vs STACK
- stack is chunk of memory
- `stack pointer`
    - points at top of stack
    - point of ingress is same as egress
        - only add to head and only remove from head
    - 2 methods for stack:
        - add to head - `push`
        - remove from heaad - `pop`
- `stack overflow` - push too much on, get 
- `under overflow` - pulling off when nothing is there

## how they work
-  have some code, and have at some point a method call eg obj.print();
    - find where method is and run it
        this print has a `return address`
    - then execute next statement

- processor has `stack` and `frame pointer`
- all processors are `stack based architectures`
    - memory can have code or data in it
- primitives in stack will make a copy
- custom objects will pass pointer

- `reverse polish notation`
- `infix math`: 5 + 3
- `postfix notiation`
    - 5 3 +
        - put 5, 3 then +
        - pop current 2, place result on stack and move on
- supposed to honor and use one point as ingress/egress
- if pass 40 params, 40 things go on stack
- when done, stack poiner just moves down 40, doesn't remove them

## stack operations
- push
- pop
- clear
- peak - look at top element

## array stack vs linked list(?)
