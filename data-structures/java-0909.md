# misc
`bare metal` - talk to processor - assembly is 1 above
Java compiled talks to JVM
Java compiles to Byte Code - is interpreted by JVM and executed

# stuff talking to processor is faster
- going to byte code vs talking direct to processor 
   - allows portability 
   - anything running JVM will run that type of code

- java programs down to JVM
- JVM is written in C++
- All codde lives inside classes
    - methods inside classes
    - `static`: available before objectr is cerwated
        - only 1 copy of static method
        - single copy is used for every reference of class
        - not static - must instantiate first
        - `main` is static bc needs to exist at start
    - `dynamic` has any number  - however many you make
        - making an instance is instantiation
        - `new`: - everything is dynamic


# data types
## `primitive` and `class`
  - always one or the other
    - "new" -- class type
    - primitive doesn't need new - `int`, `float`, `double`
    - 

- array is object but can't extend


`wrapper class` - provides extras for priimtive object
`constructor` - deprecpated
    - use

`overload methods`  vs `overwrite `- if signature is same, can overload, different, can `overwrite`

# loops
    - for and while execute minimum of 
    - 

# public
- any other class can touch
- `private` - 

`is a`
`has a`

`accessor` - getter
`mutator` - setter

`protected` - 

`package` - grouping

# Big O
- help w/ complexity of algorithms
- O(1) - complexity is 1 - no computation, easy
- O(logn)
    - recursive sort
    - choose 0 - 1,000, guess right number
        - always choose halfway point
        - 512 - 1023 == 11 guesses  - range is 500
        - 1024 - 2047 == 12 guesses - range is 1000
            - every next guess doubles the range
- O(n) - linear
    - 
- O(n squared) - quadratic
    - if double, execution goes up by 4
    - adding one step will double effert to get done
    - if two nested for loops - entering quadratic
