# Linked lists
- allocate new noes and hold data together

class Node {
    int data;
    node next; -- self referential object, refers to itself
};


`doubly linked list`
class DNode {
    int data;
    Dnode next; -- self referential object, refers to itself
    Dnode prev; -- self referential object, refers to itself
};

`ground symbol` - last one refers to null
`head` - first in linked list, reference to `node` - this is a linked list
- add new node to list is done by allocating
- can add/remove things whenever/wherever with ease
- linked list give us freedom for building data structures
- powerful, can add, delete, traverse, etc
`cons` 
- not as easily indexed
- to see one node, must see all nodes before it


# generics
- tip: first get working as non-generic, then make generic
- whole class that deals with data
- start at lowest and work out
- works for objects, not proimitives
    - otherwise will have to add `.equals` calls
- when building abstract data types, biuld them on objects
    - ths is why built `Integer` class
- generics are bound at compile time

`public class Node<E> {...}` - typically single upper case letter
    - need to make all methods support `E` 
    - instead of Integer, write E

# bag
- data structure
- can count occurrences in bag
- `grab` - retrieve one from bag
- `remove` - remove one from bag
- good to use linked list to do this

# iterator
- temp variable inside object refering to next in list
- also built in iterators in java
- `java iterator` interface works to do this
- `iterable` interface that also works
