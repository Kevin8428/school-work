- `homework should have "the" at root of tree` 
- `ragged array` - 2D array of arrays where second dimension is different length each place

# graphs
- doubly linked list and trees have multiple `connections`
- 2 types: `undirected` and `directed`
- use when having multiple data

## undirected
- every path is bi-directional
- going from A to B means you gan go from B to A
- no specs on which direction
- graphs have `vertex` (intersection), `edge` (border, outer limit)
- can create trid as 1D array 

## directed
- arrow heads tell which direction to travel
- fligt travel, gps, `anything with multiple paths to specific location`
- simplest directed is boolean - can you go this way, or not?
- can create grid (2D array) of all possible places one can move, with boolean values input

## adjacency
- is array
- quicker, lower overhead, hard to update
- can make `adjacency matrix`
    - can make 2D array with boolean or other non-primitives storing more data
## edge list (edge set)
- is linked list
- dynamic, easy to update
- one array, first value 
- for both, if you don't change number of vertices, can add/remove number of edges at will

## Searching
`depth first` and `breadth first`
### depth first  
- follow path to end, then look at next path
- need to keep track if visited a node
    - in binar trees, let recursion take care
        - same in depth first
        - can do stack or recursion
### breadth first 
- need queue
