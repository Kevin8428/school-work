# taxonomy tree
- want to know what else you can add to get more info

# binary trees
- research - can trees have duplicate values
- want l(logn) ideally - want data structures to do that
- either time complex or space complex
- can trade space for time
- removing nodes is difficult
    - who to promote/demote
    - only need to rearrange subtree values
    - will make tree not full
    - want to make full again to make `O(log n)`
- adding to trees is easy

`arrays` and `linked-list` trees

- null references off end of tree leafs

- inside tree will have reference to root of tree

# subtree
- has root just like parent root, but data set is shrinking

`root`
`leaf`
`descendent`
`ancester`
`siblings`
`node depth` 
- number of steps down from root
- depth of root is zero
`full binary tree`
- every non leaf has two children
- every leaf has same depth
- all full trees ar ecomplete trees
`complete`
- mechanism for building full trees
- if always build top/bottom/left/right
- if have leafs on right but not left, not complete
`balanced` - same depth across

- log(depth of tree) -- `O(log n)`
- depth of 5 == 2^n+1 == 2^5+1 == 64 == total nodes
- getting right number at worst case if at leaf takes 6 moves to find right number
- very efficient when tree is full
- worst case only going down 1 side of tree
- `O(n)` if tree is 100-90-80-70-60-50 only down one side with no left/right 
    - still better than `O(n square)`

`b tree`
- variable number of children per node
- always `O(log n)`

`red black tree`
- 2 children

`heap`
- `O(log n)` to add `O(log n)` to remove
- only pull off of tree at root
- cant remove random leaf/node
- only done on array based tree - not linked list tree

# linked tree
- 

# tree traversals - 3 kinds
- all depend on where you are in tree
1. pre order
- print immediately in recursion function, print left children then right
```
public void preOrder(node root) {
    if (root == null) {return;}
    print(data);
    preOrder(root.getLChild())
    preOrder(root.getRChild())
}
```
2. in order
- print middle of recursion function
- prints lowest to highest
```
public void inOrder(node root) {
    if (root == null) {return;}
    inOrder(root.getLChild())
    print(data);
    inOrder(root.getRChild())
}
```
3. post order
- last number is alwyas root
- first is left most node on lowest level
```
public void postOrder(node root) {
    if (root == null) {return;}
    postOrder(root.getLChild())
    postOrder(root.getRChild())
    print(data);
}
```
# array based bindary tree
- can run out of space at end, not case in linked tree
`final will have tree and say provide pre/mid/post order`
- limited space like any array data structure
|50|25|75|12|37|null|100|
parent * 2 + 1 = lchild
parent * 2 + 2 = rchild
25 lchild = 

# heap
- breaks rules of binary tree:
    - left child less than root, right greater
- in heap, both children are less than root
- stick root at end of tree in array
- `advantage`: always complete - build top to bottom, left to right
- to remove: put smallest number at root, and resort
- `heap sort` - useful becuase very performant O(log n)
`heapification upward`
`heapification downward`

# red-black tree
- binary tree downside: good if complete, antithesis is `linear tree`
- labels nodes red and black
- still binary tree

# b-tree
- self balancing
- always balanced, always right depth
- multiple pieces of data per node
- all leafs are same level
