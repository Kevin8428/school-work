# DNS

- CoreDNS has replaced KubeDNS as default DNS plugin
- CoreDNS runs as a Deployment
- `kubectl get services -n <name>`
- `kubectl exec -t <name> cat /etc/resolve.conf`
    - default.svc.cluster.local
    - svc.cluster.local
    - cluster.local
        - all of these will resolve
- `kubectl exec -it <name> -- nslookup kubernetes`
    - nslookup can be used to test DNS resolution

- dns policy can be set on per-pod basis
    - default is cluster first, which will inherit the name resolution configuration from the node the pod is running on
