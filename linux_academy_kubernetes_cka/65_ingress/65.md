# ingress
- ingress implements ssl
- still need to expose
    - publish as `nodeport` or pulish with cloud-native load balancer
- uses nginx etc. specify rules to implement ingress

## svc vs ingress
- can have many services, but ingress occurs before services are hit.
- ingress allows single load balancer to identify path and direct to correct service

## ingress controller
- not installed by default, must deploy one
- `nginx`, `haproxy`, `isttio` - eg
- `nginx` is supported by kubernetes project
- deployed solution, like any other deployment
    - use `nginx-ingress-controller` image
        - built for kubernetes

1. create `deployment`
1. create `service` of type `NodePort`
    - expose ingress to outside world
    - use selector to link deployment and nginx service
2. create `ServiceAccount` with correct roles and role binding
    - set permissions to access 
3. create `ConfigMap`
    - store nginx config data

## ingress resources
- rules specified to ingress controller
- eg "send to only one app" or "send to A or B depending on route or subdomain"
- built with `yaml` file
- `kind: Ingress`
- `kubectl get ingress`
