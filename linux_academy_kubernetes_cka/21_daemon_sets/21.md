# DaemonSets
- replace scheduler, still land pod on each node
- for pods that need to run 1 replica, and 1 on every node, daemonSets are perfect
- already running in kube-system namespace
    - kube-proxy runs on each node
    - kube-flannel runs on each node if installed
- if drain a pod, typically do `ignore daemonset`
- why not schedule these pods on each node?
    - Daemonsets have special instructions 
        - eg auto adding a daemonset pod to a new node coming into a cluster
        - if you delete a daemonSet pod, a Deaemonset will immediately create another pod

- `kubectl delete pods <daemonset_name> -n kube-system`
    - delete daemonset
- `kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide`
    - see new deaemonset
- when new pod is created, it uses a pod template created within itself, similar to replicaset
- DaemonSet pods ignore taints on the nodes - thats why their on master-node

# create daemonset
- `kubectl label node <name> disk=ssd`
- run yaml:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: ssd-monitor
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ssd-monitor
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ssd-monitor
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        disk: ssd
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: linuxacademycontent/ssd-monitor
```
- ^ this runs a pod with the image `linuxacademycontent/ssd-monitor` for any node with ssd label
- `kubectl create -f ssd-monitor.yaml` - create Daemonset
- `kubectl get daemonsets` - view deaemonsets
**if you label an existing node, applicable deaemonsets will deploy automatically**
- same if you remove a label, daemonset will be removed automatically
