# communicate outside cluster

## services
- provides 1 virtual interface, which is evenly distributed/assigned to pods
- all pod IP addresses can change, but from outside everything hits virtual interface "door"
- can expose any container with the applicable selector.
- expose the container port to the nodePort 

### clusterIP service
- automatically created upon cluster-creation
    - already have internally distributed load balancer by default
- takes care of internal routing of cluster
    - wherever in the cluster the pod moves, other pods know where it is and how to talk to it

### Service recap
- a Service needs to be tied to network interface
    - is just a logical grouping of IP:Port
- when a service is created in the api-server, the api-server notifies all kube-proxy agents (1 kube-proxy per node)
    - kube-proxy updates ip-table inside the node, so that traffic can be routed accordingly

### view ip tables
- `kubectl get services`
    - view CluserIP, NodePort, etc
- `kubectl get endpoints`
    - object in api-server
    - created with service
    - keeps cache of IP addresses of the pods in the service
- `sudo iptables-save | grep KUBE | grep nginx`
    - can see anything `from` pod CIDR source, `destined for` nginx nodeport IP, coming in on port 80 will be redirected to a random pod associated with the service
