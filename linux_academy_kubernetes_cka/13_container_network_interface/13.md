# container network interface

# CNI
- plugin
- aides in talk between node-to-node
- is a network overlay 
    - goes on top of existing network
    - build tunnel between nodes
- CNI simplified when connecting containers into a network
    - encapsulates packet, puts header on, changing source/destination 
        - changes from `pod1 to pod2` to `node1 to node2`

# how
- mapping in user-space where you program pod IP to node IP
- flannel decapsulates packet, hands off to bridge

# flannel install
- a version of CNI
- `kubectl apply -f https://github.com/coreos/flannel/fdaikfis/kube-flannel.yml`
    - creates cluster role
    - cluster role binding
    - service account
    - configmap
    - daemonsets

## flannel usage
- once CNI is installed it installs a `network agent` on each node - which ties to the CNI interface
- to use CNI, notify kubelet
    - needs to know CNI is used by setting `network-plugin` flag to CNI
- `sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cider=10.244.0.0/16`
    - notify kubelet want to use CNI plugin
- container runtime calls CNI runtime executable to add/remove instance to/from containers networking namespace
