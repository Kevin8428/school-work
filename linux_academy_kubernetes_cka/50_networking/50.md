# network

## key commands
- `ip link` - list/modify interfaces on host
- `ip addr` - view ip addresses assigned to interfaces
- `ip addr add <destination> via eth0` - set ip addresses on interfaces
    - all of these are ephemeral
    - to persist, set in `/etc/network/interfaces`
- `ip route` or `route` - view routing table
- `ip route add` - add to routing table
- `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` - check if ip forwarding is enabled on a host, if working on host configured as a router

## switch
- 2 computers, how does A reach B
    - connect to `switch` - creates a network, containing both computers
    - to connect them to switch, need an interface on each host 
        - physical or virtual
        - `iplink` - view interfaces for the host
            - look at `eth0` interface
                - used to connect to switch
    - assume switch is network with ip 1.2.3.0
        - assign ip addresses:
        - `ip addr add 1.2.3.1/24 dev etho0` 
        - `ip addr add 1.2.3.2/24 dev etho0` 
            - now computers can communicate to each other thru the switch
        - switch can only enable communication within a network
            - can receive/deliver for computers on the network

## router
- connects systems on 2 different networks
- like a server w/ many network ports
- connecting 2 networks:
    - gets 2 ips assigned - 1 for each network
    - when system 1 talks to system 2,
- `route` - view existing routing config on a system
    - display `routing table`
    - if nothing present, computers cant reach out to others outside own system
- must configure gateway. Add to `routing table`:
    - `ip route add <destination> via <gateway>`
    - `ip route add <switch_2_ip> via <router_ip_for_switch_1>`

/ server_1_system_1
/ server_2_system_1
/ switch_system_1 - this has an ip switch_1_ip

/ switch_1_ip
/ switch_2_ip
/ router - registers router_ip_for_switch_1 and router_ip_for_switch_2

/ server_1_system_2
/ server_2_system_2
/ switch_system_2 - this has an ip switch_2_ip

### default gateway
- need to register every communication
- to allow all outside ip's thru router set default:
- `ip route add default via <router_ip_for_switch_2>` equal to:
- `ip route add 0.0.0.0 via <router_ip_for_switch_2>`
    - `router_ip_for_switch_2` can access anything in the world

**if having trouble accessing outside internet, routing table and default gateway are good suspects**

- in linux, packets aren't forwarded by default
- `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`
    - governs if a host can forward packets between interfaces
    - by default, value is set to `0` - no forward
        - set to `1` will show `ping` response
- changes to `ip_forward` will not persist
    - to persist, make change in `/etc/sysctl.conf`
