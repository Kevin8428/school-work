# pod networking

## requirements
- every pod should have an IP address
- every pod can talk to every pod in the node
- every pod can talk to every pod on other nodes WITHOUT NAT

- flannel is one solution

## solve without flannel
- have 3 node cluster, each are same
- nodes are part of external network
- all on 192.168.1.x series

1. create bridge network on each node
    - `ip link add v-net-0 type bridge`
2. bring it up
    - `ip link set dev v-net-0 up`
3. assign ip address to bridge network
    - each bridge network on own subnet
    - `10.244.1.0/24`
    - `10.244.2.0/24`
    - `10.244.3.0/24`
4. set ip address for bridge interface
    - `ip addr add 10.244.1.1/24 dev v-net-0`
    - `ip addr add 10.244.2.1/24 dev v-net-0`
    - `ip addr add 10.244.3.2/24 dev v-net-0`
5. need to do the following for each/every container:
    - attach container to network
        - create veth pair
        - `ip link add ...`
    - attach 1 end to container
        - `ip link set ...`
    - attach 1 end to bridge
        - `ip link set ...`
    - assign ip address
        - `ip -n <namespace> addr add`
    - add route to default gateway
        - `ip -n <namespace> route add`
