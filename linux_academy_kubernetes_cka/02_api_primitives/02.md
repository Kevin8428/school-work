`api-server`
- inter-cluster happens with a call to `api-server`
    - every k8s componentt communicates with `api-server` and `api-server` only
        - components don't talk directly
- only one talking to etcd and modify cluster state
    - all others go thru `api-server` to communicate with etcd
- `componentstatus` - exposes api-resource 
    - show all components of master node aka `control plane` and status of each
    - `kubectl get componentstatus`
        - shows:
            - scheduler - healthy
            - controller-manager - healthy
            - etcd - healthy

- objects like pods/services are `persistent entities`
    - kubernetes uses these entities to represent state for cluster
        - therefore creating record of intent
- once you create object, k8s works to always keep in this state
- provide intent to kubectl as YAML

YAML:
`spec`
- `status` - nested object field in spec, describe state of object
    - returned to control-plane
    - returns state of object
- if `spec` and `status` are ever not the same, control-plane will fix and make them match

- kubectl converts YAML to JSON as API request must be done as JSON in request body

`kind` - kind of object you want to create
- can do pod, job, daemon, replicaset, replication-controller and more
`metadata` - data to ID object like namespace, UID etc
- every object has name/uid. 
- can only have one name per object type.
    - can't hav 2 pods named "nginx" at the same time
`label`
- arbitrary key:value pair attached to an object
- can then select objects based on label selectors
    - eg `env:production` - can use label selectors to perform actions on just pods with those labels: `kubectl get pods -L env`
- can apply one or more labels before or after creation of object
- object can't have duplicate label of same name
`annotiations`
- key:value pairs but w/o identifying information
- can add annotation before/after object is created
`field-selector`
- command used to fetch all objects based on field
    - eg `kubectl get pods --field-selector status.phase=Running`
