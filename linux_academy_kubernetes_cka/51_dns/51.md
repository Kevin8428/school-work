# DNS

## DNS server
#### record types:
`A` record is storing IP to host-names - very common
`AAAA` record is storing IPv6 to host-names
`CNAME` record is mapping one name to another name
    - eg multiple aliases. can reach a site at eat.server or hungry.server

server A -- something -- server B

- `/etc/hosts`
    - tell server A to alias server B ip with `server-b`
- `hostname`
    - run on server B
    - shows real name of server B is `host-2`
        - server A doesn't care, goes by whats in /etc/hosts
- `dns-server`
    - takes care of the `/etc/hosts` work
    - all hosts/servers do resolution using dns-server

## point host to DNS server
- `/etc/resolve.conf` - specify dns-server address here
    - every host has dns resolution config file here
    - add entry here specifying address off dns-server:
        - `nameserver <dns_server_ip>`
    - everytime a host comes up with a hostname it doesn't know about, looks in dns-server
    - if host ip changes, simply update dns-server, all hosts will resolve going forward
- can still use etc/resolve.conf or dns-server
    - if match, will first look at /etc/hosts by default
- `/etc/nsswitch.conf` - can change ranking order between /etc/host and dns-server

- ping dns not listed anywhere? 
    - will fail

### subdomains
- `web.mycompany.com`
- `web` specifies a given service, cluster, etc
- want to allow services within network to use `web` to make this easier. Still expect outside world to use `web.mycompany.com`
- `/etc/resolve.conf` inside `web`
    - `search mycompany.com`
    - now someone saying `ping web` will hit `web.mycompany.com`

# NSLOOKUP
- does not consider entries in `/etc/host` file
- only queries DNS server
