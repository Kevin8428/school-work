# Architecture
- 2 roles: `master` and `worker`
- 1 or many masters
- 0 or many workers

## node
- machine in which you can install kubernetes and a runtime
- has pods, which contains 1 or many containers running app
- it doesn't matter which node app components reside on, they talk same from anywhere in cluster
- kubernetes can reorder to different nodes without any noticeable difference
- k8s takes care of scaling, load balancing and leader election

/cluster
    /worker_node_1
        /pod_1
            /container_1
        /pod_2
            /container_1
            /container_2
            /container_3
        /kubelet
        /kube-proxy
        /container-runtime
    /worker_node_1
        /pod_1
            /container_1
        /kubelet
        /kube-proxy
        /container-runtime
    /master_node_1 - control plane
        /api-server
        /scheduler
        /controller-manager
        /etcd
```

`containers` are on `pods` are on `nodes`

## master node  - control plane
- master node will never contain pods or be responsible for running application components. 
- Can be replicated for high availability - recommended
- initiates and follows instructions according to a spec to deploy pods and the containers within
1. api-server
    - communication hub for all cluster components
    - all others point to it, reach out to it to request information
    - exposes k8s API
2. scheduler
    - assigns application to a worker node
    - auto detect which pod to place on which node based on resource requirements, hardware constraints, and other factors
3. controller-manager
    - maintains the cluster. Handles node failures, replicating components, maintaining correct amount of pods etc.
4. etcd
    - datastore that stores cluster configuration
    - recommended to back this up incase cluster crashes

## worker node
- run app and monitor, and provide services needed
- makes sure application stays in same state as specified in the description. 
    - If not, k8s will fix it automatically
        - this is `declaritive intent` - don't manually check cluster, k8s will keep in desired state
1. kubelet
    - run/manages containers on node
    - talks to api server
    - points to container-runtime because will contact container-runtime like docker to go out and pull images required to run pod
    - tells docker to pull images from image registry 
        - docker provisions contianer and runs on worker node
2. kube-proxy
    - load-balances traffic between app components
3. container-runtime
    - program that runs containers like docker, rocket, or container-d

- once you describe image that contains app, scheduler on master node schedules specified group of containers onto nodes
- then cubelet instructs container run-time to pull images and run containers

## namespace
- virtual cluster
- virtual separation between environments
- clusters with a few users, use single namespace
- come in handy to divide cluster resources between users, when worried one group/team will use more resources then available in cluster
