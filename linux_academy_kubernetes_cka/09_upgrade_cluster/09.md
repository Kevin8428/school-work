# check current versions of components

- `kubectl get nodes`
    - not sure which version it pertains to
        - kubelet, kubectl, kubecontroller etc
- `kubectl version --short`
    - shows version of kubectl and api-server
- `kubectl describe nodes`
    - kubelet version
    - kube-proxy version
- `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`
    - version of kube-contoller-manager
    1. copy name of pod
    2. `kubectl get pods <name> -o yaml -n kube-system`
        - look at `image:...:1.15.9` - version is 1.15.9

# upgrade versions
- use `kubeadm` to upgrade all other components. First upgrade kubeadm:
- previously "held" versions to stop from auto-upgrading, now need to "unhold"
    - `sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm kubelet`
    - `sudo apt install -y kubeadm=1.16.6-00`
        - install kubeadm on master node
    - `sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm`
        - hold version
    - `kubeadm version`
        - view version

## upgrade other control plane compnents after kubeadm - not kubectl
- `sudo kubeadm upgrade plan`
    - shows current versions and whats available to upgrade to
- `sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.16.1`
    - perform upgrade to:
        - `api-server`
        - `controller-manager`
        - `scheduler`
        - `kube-proxy`
        - `coreDNS`
        - `etcd`
    - pull most recent versions of components and switch them out

## upgrade kubectl

### upgrade control plane SERVER kubelet
- `sudo apt install -y kubelet=1.16.6-00`
- `kubectl get nodes` - verify upgrade worked for master node kubectl
- `kubectl version --short`
    - shows client/server, show client is still not upgrade

### upgrade control plane CLIENT kubectl
- `sudo apt-mark unhold kubectl`
- `sudo apt-install -y kubectl=1.16.6-00`

- `kubectl version --short` - verify both client/server are updated

### upgrade worker CLIENT/SERVER kubectl/kubelet
- `sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl`
- access worker node 1 (ssh?)
- `sudo apt-mark unhold kubelet`
- `sudo apt install -y kubelet=1.16.6-00`
- `sudo apt-mark hold kubelet`
