# app failures
eg setup:
- DB -> db-service -> web -> web-service -> user
eg problem: user can't access app
1. `web server` - is it accessible? curl ip of node-port
    - `curl http://service-ip:node-port`
2. `service` - has it discovered endpoints for the pod?
    - `kubectl describe svc web-service` - look at endpoints
    - compare selectors to svc and pod to match
3. `pod` - is it in running state?
    - `kubectl describe pod web`
    - `kubectl logs web -f`
    - `kubectl logs web -f --previous`
4. `db-service` - check status
5. `db` - look at db logs

- control plane components can be deployed as pods or services
    - kubeadm deploys as pods
# control plane failures
1. `kubectl get nodes`
2. `kubectl get pods`
3. `kubectl get pods -n kube-system` - eg kubeadm deploys control plane componenets as pods
4. `svc kube-apiserver status` - if control plane components are services
5. `svc kube-controller-manager status`
6. `svc kube-scheduler status`
7. `svc kubelet status` - worker
8. `svc kube-proxy status` - worker

get logs of control plane
- in kubeadm use kubectl logs
9. `kubectl logs kube-api-server-master -n kube-system`
- for services configured natively on control plane
10. `journalctl -u kube-apiserver`

# worker node failures
1. `kubectl describe node worker-1`
    - if status is `Unknown`
        - could be offline
        - check heartbeat
2. `top`
3. `df -h`
4. `svc kubelet status`
5. `journalctl -u kubelet`
5. `openssl x509 -in /var/lib/kubelet/worker-1.crt -text`
    - confirm `Issuer` is correct
    - confirm not expired

# networking failures
