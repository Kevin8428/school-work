# TLS
- guarantee trust between 2 parties in a transaction
- ensures encryption
- ensures each party is identified
- user access web-server
    - TLS ensures server is who it says it is
    - TLS ensures talk is encrypted

## WHY need
- user inputs name/pw for info
- someone sniffing network traffic could get and sign in
- must encrypt using `encryption key`

## encryption key
### symetric encryption
0. get `symetric key` and send to server
    - this is a private key
    - if hacker gets key, can decrypt message
1. get new random alpha numeric
2. add this random number to data and encrypt
3. send to server - hacker sniffing cant use
4. server needs symetric key to decrypt
- secure, but risk of hacker getting key
- therefore use `asymmetric encryption`

## how can we safely send symetric key to server?
- once this is done client/server can safely communicate
- to securely transfer symetric key from client to server, use asymetric encryption
1. generate public:private on server
2. `openssl genrsa -out my-bank.key 1024`
    - generate private:public key pair for server
        - `my-bank.key`
        - `mybank.pem`
3. when user first access' server w/ https, they get public key from server
4. users browser encrypts `public key` from server using `symetric key`
    - `symetric key` is now secure
5. encrypted `symetric key` is sent to server
6. server uses server's private key do decrypt message and `symetric key`
    - hacker sniffing isn't able to w/out server private key
7. now client/server both have `symetric key` and can safely send encrpyted data


## asymmetric encryption
- use pair of keys, `private` and `public`
    - think of key/lock where private is key, public is lock
- encrypt with lock, and decrypt with key
- so public/lock can be shared, but private can not
- people can encrypt/lock using public/lock
- only way to decrypt/unlock is using private/key


## asymmetric SSH
- secure access to server w/ key:pair
- passwords are too risky, so use key:pair
- `ssh-keygen` - generate public/private
    - creates:
    - `id_rsa` - private
    - `id_rsaa.pub` - public 
- secure server by locking down all access
    - accept thru door locked using public lock
    - add entry w/ public key into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
        - `ssh-rsa AAABfdfsafdsfdsaasd user1`
- the lock is public and anyone can try to break thru
    - as long as noone gets private key, noone gets access
- `ssh -i id_rsa user1@server1`
    - specify location of private key in ssh command

how do you secure more than 1 server w/ key:pair?
- create copies of public lock, and place on all servers
- same private key to access w/ public key

what if other users need acces?
- they can create their own public:private pairs and add public lock to authorize_keys
    - so now multiple private keys can access server

## how to confirm the server is not a hacker server
- typically in handshake user gets public key, you encrypt with private `symetric key` and send back. Hacker can decrypt symetric key with their own public:private key combo
- solution: when server sends key, send certificate w/ key in it
    - certificate shows who issued to, public key, location of server
    - who issued to 
- who signed/issued is important
- if you sign/issue yourself, it's a `self-signed certificate`
    - if this is the case, it's not safe
    - browsers check certificate to see if legitimate
    - if is fake, will warn you
- create legit cert:
- use `certificate authority`
    - `openssl req -new -key my-bank.key...`
        - CA verifies and sign if valid/legit

- how does browser know who is a legit CA?
- CA's have public keys that browsers use
    - this doesn't help w/ private hosted sites
    - need own private CA
        - CA server you can deploy privately
            - can have
