# kubelet
- sole point of contact from master
- `scheduler` on master tells `kubelet` to add/remove pods
- reports on status of node

- register node w/ cluster
- when neeed to load pod, request `container runtime` to pull required image

## install
- always needs to be installed manually
- run as service

# view
- `ps -aux` - all running processes
- `ps -aux | grep kubelet`
    - view kubelet and options


# kube-proxy
- process that runs on each node
- looks for new services, and adds appropriate rules on each node to forward traffic to those services to backend pods
this is done by multiple sources:
1. `ip-tables rule`
- kube-proxy creates rule in each node to forward traffic heading to IP of service to the IP of the pod

# install
- `kubeadm` deploys kube-proxy as a pod on each node
- is actually a daemonset

# POD NETWORK
- alls all pods to talk
- spans all nodes
- all pods connect to it
- internal virtual network

- `services` can't join pod network bc not an actual thing/container
    - stored in memory, loaded from yaml manifest files
