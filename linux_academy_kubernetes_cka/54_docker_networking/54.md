# docker networking
- single docker host 
    - server w/ docker installed
    - ethernet interface at eth0
    - ip 1.2.3.4
- `--network none` 
    - none network
    - container isn't attached to any network
    - can't talk to outside world or each other
- `host network`
    - container is attached to host
    - no isolation between container and host
        - deploy web app listening on port 80, app is available by default on host on 80
            - can't run 2 processes on same port
- `bridge network`
    - internal private network
    - `172.17.0.0` -default ip
    - docker host and containers attach to
    - each device connecting gets own internal network address

# bridge network in docker
- `docker0` === `bridge`
- when docker is installed, it creates `bridge` network by default
- `docker network ls` - shows `bridge` network
- docker calls network by name `bridge`, but on host it's called `docker0`
- `ip link` - shows `docker0`
- `ip addr`- shows `docker0` is assigned ip `172.17.0.1`

- when a container is created, docker creates a network namespace for it
- `ip netns` - list namespace
- `docker inspect <id>` - where do you get this id?

# how does docker attach container/network namespace to bridge network?
1. create virtual cable w/ interfaces on each end
- `ip link` - see bridge side of interface
- `ip -n <id_from_"ip netns"_command> link` - see other end of interface
- `ip -n <id_from_"ip netns"_command> addr` - interface ip assigned - ie containers ip

## docker when new container is created:
1. create ns
2. create pair of interfaces - attach each to container/bridge network
- interface pairs can be identified using their numbers, odd/even form a pair
    - eg bridge interface -> `veth324n@if11` <--> `eth0@if12` <-- container interface
    - eg bridge interface -> `veth324n@if13` <--> `eth0@if14` <-- container interface
    - eg bridge interface -> `veth324n@if15` <--> `eth0@if16` <-- container interface

# port mapping
- allow outside internet to access
- when running containers, map 8080 on host to 80 on container

## how
- add rule to docker chain, set destination to containers IP and port 80
- `iptables -nvL -t nat` - view docker rule in ip tables
