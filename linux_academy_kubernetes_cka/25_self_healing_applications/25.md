# self healing applications

# replicaSets
- ensure replicas, if lose a node, no downtime
- create replicas and place on healthy nodes
example:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: myreplicaset
  labels:
    app: app
    tier: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: linuxacademycontent/kubeserve
```
- `tier: frontend` - any pods w/ this label will be picked up by this replicaSet
1. create this replicaset
2. create pod w/ label `tier: frontend`
3. will auto scale to 3 replicas
- Deployments manage replicasets

## stateful sets
- allow you to keep number of replicas alive
- pods in stateful set are unique
    - when one dies, replaced by one w/ same hostname and configurations
- want to create pods that are unique? don't want errors 
- service in stateful sets is `headless` bc each pod is going to be unique
    - headless service is a service without load-balancing or a single Service IP.
    - need certain traffic going to certain pods
eg: 
```
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: www
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```
- volumeClaimTemplates
    - bc each pod in a stateful set needs it own storage, bc it's unique
