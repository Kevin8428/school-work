# secure persistent key:value store
- when passing config info to containers: 
    - info might be sensative
    - info might need to live beyond life of pod
    - secrets solve this

# secrets(cont'd from 24)
- mount secret to pod using volume
- secrets are maps holding key:value
- can pass to container as env vars, or expose as files in volume

- apps usually dump env vars in error reports, or write them to logs at startup, which exposes them
    - best to not expose these
- secrets mounted thru volumes are stored in memory, and never written to physical storage
- secret uses in-memory file storage `tmpfs`
- every pod has a secret volume attached automatically - the default one
    - when you expose secret to container thru secret volume, value is decoded and written to file in actual form
        - app doesn't decode it, just looks at values

- `kubectl get secrets`
- `kubectl describe pod <pod_name>`
    - can see default secret in containers.mount
- `kubectl describe secret <secret_name>`
    - see cert, namespace, and token

# want to send HTTPS traffic to site?
- need to generate cert and key, and need them secure
    - perfect for secrets
1. gen private key file: `openssl genrsa -out https.key 2048`
2. gen certificate: `openssl req -new -x509 -key https.key -out https.cert -days 3650 -subj /CN=www.example.com`
3. create empty file for secret: `touch file`
have:
- key
- cert
- file
4. create secret `kubectl create secret generic example-https --from-file=https.key --from-file=https.cert --from-file=file`
- secret type is `generic`
5. view `kubectl get secrets`
6. view yaml `kubectl get secrets example-https -o yaml`
- cert and key are now base64 encoded
7. Create the configMap that will mount to your pod:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: config
data:
  my-nginx-config.conf: |
    server {
        listen              80;
        listen              443 ssl;
        server_name         www.example.com;
        ssl_certificate     certs/https.cert;
        ssl_certificate_key certs/https.key;
        ssl_protocols       TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
        ssl_ciphers         HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

        location / {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }

    }
  sleep-interval: |
    25
```
- `my-nginx-config.conf` specifies ssl listen on 443
8. mount secret in pod
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-https
spec:
  containers:
  - image: linuxacademycontent/fortune
    name: html-web
    env:
    - name: INTERVAL
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: config
          key: sleep-interval
    volumeMounts:
    - name: html
      mountPath: /var/htdocs
  - image: nginx:alpine
    name: web-server
    volumeMounts:
    - name: html
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      readOnly: true
    - name: config
      mountPath: /etc/nginx/conf.d
      readOnly: true
    - name: certs
      mountPath: /etc/nginx/certs/
      readOnly: true
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    - containerPort: 443
  volumes:
  - name: html
    emptyDir: {}
  - name: config
    configMap:
      name: config
      items:
      - key: my-nginx-config.conf
        path: https.conf
  - name: certs
    secret:
      secretName: example-https
```
- mount certs to `/etc/nginx/certs/`
- mount config to `/etc/nginx/conf.d`

9. get mounts and view in memory filesystem
- `kubectl exec example-https -c web-server -- mount | grep certs`
    - see in memory file system tmpfs

10. open port 443 and see if serving HTTPS traffic
