# service and network primitives

## services
- allows you to dynamically access a group of replica pods
- service now has one port/`ip address`
    - IP ADDRESS IS A VIRTUAL IP ADDRESS
        - does not have physical `nic`??
- service routes traffic to new pod once old pod has gone away
- each pod is assigned an IP address
    - all pods communicate the same  - one flat layer
- how you still get to application after pod IP is gone
`packet flow:`
- when service is created in api-server, virtual ip address is assigned immediately
    - then api-server notifies `kube-proxy` that new service has been created
        - then `kube-proxy` makes sure service is reachable by setting up `ip tables` rules
            - done to ensure packet reaches destination, being `ip:port` pair of the service
            - now when a pod tries to reach out to another pod, destination is initially set to `ip:port` pair of the service
                - however, once packet reaches `ip tables` rules, the destination changes. It is now the `ip:port` of a dynamically selected pod
        - `ip table rules`- one table per node
`spec` for service
- type: nodeport
    - reserve a port on all nodes in cluster
        - same port is used for all nodes
        - forwards incoming connections to the pods that are part of the service
            - how to specify pods for a service? `label`
            - `label selectors` are used to apply service to pods that have label
`kube-proxy`
- runs on each worker node, load balances traffic between app components (including service component)
- handles all traffic for a service
- `services consist of ip and port pair`
