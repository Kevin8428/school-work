questions:
`ip link show` vs `ip route show`


commands:
`ip link`
`ip link show <id>`
`ip route`
`ip route show <id>`s
`ip addr`
`netstat -nplt`
`netstat -anp`
`netstat -anp | grep etcd`

`ip link` shows status, `ip addr` shows configuration

`ip addr `
- show ip address configuration
- shows config for every interface on machine
- aka `ip a`
`ip addr show dev <id>` 
- show id

`ip route show`
`netstat -anp`
- finding a connection to/from host
- `-a` -- display all connections including TCP and UDP
`arp <thing>`

# arp
- show current mappings the machine knows about
`arp -n`- raw numeric value

# docker0 interface
- virtual bridge interface
- all docker containers are connected to docker0 bridge by default

# interface type
- loopback 
    - `lo0`
    - local
- bridge 
    - `br0`
    - join wired/wireless on same local segments, w/ common network address
- virtual 
    - `eth0.10`
- tunnel
    - `tun0`

# interfaces
- application can listen on a specific interface
    - if server isn't connected to ip interface, it can't access the app

`0.0.0.0`
- if this is listen target, app will listen to every network interface
    - bad security, exposes to entire world


`ip link `
- shows status of hardware
- see interfaces
- can see if they are up/down
- `LOWER_UP` - means link at physical layer
- see MAC address: `link/ether 00:0c:...`
    - id's interfaces
`ip link`
- display info about interfaces
`ip link show <id>` eg `ip link show default`
- display info about id (here default)


example interfaces:
`loopback interface`
- `lo` abbreviation
- this is linux host itself
- always has `127.0.0.1/`
- nework with only 1 computer: your own
- aka `localhost`
- `eth0`
    - 
- `eth1`
    - 
- `eth2`
    - 

######
# ifconfig 
- stand for `interface config`
- print list of network interfaces and details
```
eth0: flags=<...RUNNING...>
        inet 1.2.3.4 -- this is the ip address - this is public
eth1: flags=<...RUNNING...>
        inet 1.2.3.5 -- this is the ip address - this is private
lo: flags=<...RUNNING...>
        inet 127.0.0.1 -- this is the ip address - this is local
```
# netstat
- stand for `network statistics`
- info about network
- print all connections inside host - lots of info
`netstat -tln`
`-t` - tcp
`-l` - listening sockets - open ports
`-n` - show IPS as numbers, dont resolve host name
this returns:
```
local addresses:
0.0.0.0:22 <-- ssh port, 0:0:0:0 means SSH is available on all interfaces
    - ipV4
127.0.0.1:25 <-- smtp port; port 25 is only open on loopback interface
    - so port 25 is not accessible outside this host
    - ipV4
:::8080 <-- personal app
    - ipV6 version of 0.0.0.0
```
- remember a server can have many ip addresses/bindings
- can say "binding app 1 to 0.0.0.0:22" 
    - somone on internet can do `curl server_ip:22` and access
    - somone inside private network can do `curl ip_of_same_computer_in_network:22` and access
    - `localhost:22` can access
- can say "binding app 2 to 127.0.0.1:25" 
    - only this machine can do can do `curl server_ip:22` and access
