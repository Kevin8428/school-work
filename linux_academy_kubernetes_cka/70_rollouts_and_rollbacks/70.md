# Rollout
When you create a deployment, this happens:
1. rollout is triggered
2. a new deployment revision is created eg `revision 1`

When you update the app
3. new rollout is triggered
4. new deployment revision is created `revision 2`
    - this keeps track of deployment and enables rollback

`kubectl rollout status deployment/my-deployment`
- see status of rollout
`kubectl rollout history deployment/my-deployment`
- see revisions/history of deployment

## 2 types of deployment strategy
- `recreate` - destroy all before upping new version
- `rolling update` - replace 1 by 1. much better and is default.

# upgrades
- upate image, label, replicas etc
- edit file and `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`
    - new rollout is triggered
    - new deployment is created

DETAILS
- when new deployment created:
1. create replicaset
- when upgrading deploy:
2. `deploy` object creates new replicaset and deploys containers
3. 1 by 1 take down old replicasets
`kubectl get rs` - will show old/new both existing during rollout
- when rollback
4. `kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-deployment`
    - will bring up old replicaset

`kubectl run` - creates pod and deployment
