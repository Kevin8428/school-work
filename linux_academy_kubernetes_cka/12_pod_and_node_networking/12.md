# networking from pod to pod in one node, or when pod wants to talk to pod on another node

- networking uses linux network namespaces
- `veth` - virtual ethernet devices
- `networking interface` - allows a computer to connect to a LAN using ethernet
- `ethernet networking interface` - 
- `eth0 interface` - first ethernet interface
- `eth0` on pod is related to `veth` address on the node

# inside 1 node:
- each pod has an IP address
    - it receives ip address from `virtual ethernet interface pair`
    - one of the `virtual ethernet interfaces` is given to pod, and renamed `eth0`
    - `kubectl get pods -o wide` - see which node pod is on
    1. ssh into node
    2. `ifconfig` - look for `veth` interface, which is linked to container

## container
- view all containers in node: inside node: `sudo su -`
- get PID of container: `docker inspect --format '{{ .State.Pid }}' <container_id>`
- run a command in the process' network namespace: `nsenter -t <pid> -n ip addr`

## 2 pods talking inside a node
- this requires a `bridge`
    - linux bridge
    - discovers destination using `arp` request
    - hands out addresses to each pod

## 2 pods talking on different nodes
- source ip on pod 1 is private 
    - therefore ip changes as the packet goes from one node to another
    - ip changes to `eth0` ip address of the node housing pod 1
    - change ip because if pod ip was sent to the router, it would drop the packets having no awareness of the private ip referred to
    - packet is then decapsulated and sent over network to node which contains pod 2
    - node-to-node talking is done thruu `container-network-interface`
    - `alternative to above:`- could configure with `layer-3 routing`
        - cons: becomes harder as more nodes and pods are added
