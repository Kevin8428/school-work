- what if don't have resources to replicate components, or working in development cluster and dont need high availability
- what if you want to monitor cluster? what if it takes equal or less time to recover without HA? what if you want to simplify setup process

- Items needed to backup cluster:
    - `etcd` - persistent datastore, stores cluster state
    - if etcd is external to cluster it's a good idea to backup
    - etcd client utilty can take snapshot of datastore to use for recovery
1. get etcd binaries: `wget https://github.com/coreos/etc/releases/...v1.2.3.tar.gz`
2. unzip `tar xzf etcd-xxx...`
3. move to /usr/loca/bin `sudo mv etcd-xxx... /usr/local/bin`
4. take snapshot: `sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot save snapshot.db --cacert /etc...`
    - saved at `snapshot.db`
    - certificates included, which are found at `etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd`
    - snapshot saved in home directory
5. backup snapshot.db and certificates in location other than this cluster

NOTE:
- `etcd restore` creates an entirely new cluster and replaces etcd keyspaces from backup
- if lost node, and decomission server - new server must have same IP address as original

overview:
1. create new etcd data directory for each node of clusgter
2. specify cluster IDs, token and peer urls
3. start etcd with new data directories in tact
