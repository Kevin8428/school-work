# Systemd
- init system
- manages start/stop/restart services
- manage how services come up when you start a machine
- details of how a process starts

# units
- daemons, background programs
- systemd calls deamons processes `units`
- systemd helps manage daemons/units

`systemctl list-units`
- slices, sockets etc
`systemctl list-units | grep .service`
- just whats installed
`systemctl status <unit>`
- see whats going on
- see if active, enabled etc
    - `enabled` - going to start with system/computer
`systemctl disable <unit>`
- disabled - doesn't kill, just stops from running next time
`systemctl stop <unit>` - kill/inactivate

# other useful commands
`systemctl --failed` - show what has failed `GODO DEBUGGER - catch error message`
`systemctl restart <unit>` - made changes to config? restart w/ new
`systemctl is-denabled <unit>` - get if enabled?
`systemctl enable`
- run on startup. can disable, but run manually if you want
1. enable
2. start
`systemctl reboot`
`systemctl poweroff`
`systemctl suspend` - suspend machine to RAM

# journalctl 
- handle logging
`journalctl`
`journalctl -b` 
- logs from current boot
- have startup problems? this will show errors
`journalctl -n <unit>`

## boot process
- computer starts, `BIOS` on motherboard checks on all hardware on input/output devices
- boot process beings for compuer
- boot process:
    - typical GRUB - grand unified boot loader
1. look for where in hardrive is data needed to boot OS
2. boot loader then loads linux kernel
3. kernel then loads initial RAM disk
    - contains device driver 
4. RAM disk laods drives to mount filesystem from hard disk
5. once kernel is ready, starts `initialization system` (init system)
6. once started, kernel mounts filesystems, and RAM disk isn't needed
7. init system loads services and gets computer in ready state
8. 



## kernel 
- main goal is process input/output given
- regardless of where it's from
- interact w/ computer hardware

# init
- short for initialization
- based of `system V` init system used in UNIX systems - aka `sys B init`
- CON for old init system: 
    - services start one after another
    - sometimes services wouldn't be ready and could hang system

## how it works
- kernel loads and brings in RAM disk
- seeks ouut init system to hand off control of computer
    - looks for `/sbin/init` and runs
        - now init is in control
### init jobs on startup
1. read configs in `/etc/inittab`
    - init wants to know what run level to run OS in
    - `run level` 
        - config the computer operates within
        - default has been level 3 - multi-user with networking
        - start/stop scripts for different services depending on how system should be setup
        - halt, single-user, multi-user, unused, etc
        - can only run in one level at a time, applies to system at a whole
`id:3:initdefault:`
- `identifier:run_level:action:process`
`si:sysinit:/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit`
- sysinit - when system boots, anything in process field, will be ran

- init scripts
    - /etc/rc.d/ - rc == `run commands`
    - /etc/init.d/

# upstart
- alternate to `init`
- can start/stop services async
    - decreased boot time
- services in parallel

- not great async still
- net great performance still
    - booted daemons not needed
^^ therefore built systemd

# systemd architecture
## process mgmt
- all processes are managed in `cgroups`
- `cgroups`
    - provides resource limits on RAM, CPU etc
    - processes grouped together in a heirarchy
    - linux kernel feature
    - grouping/labeling
- systemd uses own type of cgroups
    - used to confine services/processes
        - these are `slices`
- `slices` grouping of services
    - partition schema for services
    - `/sys/fs/cgroup/systemd` - view slices here 
- `system.slice` - services running on system
    - httpd.service
    - crond.service
- `user.slice` - user services
    - desktop session
    - each user gets own slice
### scopes
- sets of processes
- contain runtime parameters of running processes
- created at runtime

scope eg
- system starts, user.slice is created for user accounts
- user logs in, gets portion of slice

#### systemd-cgls
- show breakdown of processes and slice they belong to
`systemd-cgls`
/pid 1 - reserved for init
/system.slice - all services running for system
/user.slice
    /user-0.slice - all services running for user
        /session-4.scope
            /bash
            /some_daemon
    /user-1.slice
        /session-9.scope
            /ssh
            /bash
            /some_daemon

#### systemd-cgtop
`systemd-cgtop`
- shows top cgroups based on resource useage
- if running heavy load, want to see how many resources a slice/service is using, this shows that

# autofs
- only mount once someone needs it
- services are queued up and pulled in by systemd when needed
