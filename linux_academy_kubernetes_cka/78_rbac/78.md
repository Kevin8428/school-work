# RBAC

# role
- create roles, assign users to roles
- roles can give permissions to things like creating pods, creating configmaps etc
1. create a role w/ a `Role` file
2. create yaml w/ `kind: Role`
3. create rules. Each rule has 3 sections:
    - apiGroups
    - resources - eg pods
    - verbs - LIST, GET, CREATE, DELETE, UPDATE
4. `kubectl create -f some_role.yaml` - create
5. link user to role using `role binding`

# role binding
- link user to role
1. create yaml w/ `kind: RoleBinding`

`kubectl auth can-i <action> <object>`
    - eg `kubectl auth can-i delete nodes`
`kubectl get roles` - view roles
`kubectl describe role <name>`
