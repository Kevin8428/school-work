# Building a cluster
- won't need to build cluster from scratch
- k8s comes with module `cloud-provider`
    - can build on bare metal without tho
- k8s binary release includes all k8s binaraies including etc

- kube-proxy can run on pod (recommended)
    - `kubelet` is only thing that must run on system, not a pod
        - this is because it runs the pods
    - also installed on node

- can use HTTPS to hit api-server 
    - recommended for production

- `kubectl cluster-info`
    - where master and kube-dns is running
- `kubectl config view`
    - brief config of cluster
