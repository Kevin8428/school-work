# persistent volume claims
- request volume for use by the pod
- way to reserve already provisioned storage for use by a pod
- storage cannot be used directly in pod, so must create a claim for it
- claim stays with pv even if pod is deleted/replaced
- pvc is a separate resource
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mongodb-pvc 
spec:
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: ""
```
- `storage` can't be higher than storage available - will throw erro
1. create claim
    - checks requested size and access mode, make sure match avail volumes
    - if there's a volume available with read/write once access policy, and 1GB
        - `volume is bound to claim`
2. verify
    - `kubectl get pvc`
        - confirm status=bound
    - `kubectl get pv`
        - confirm status=bound
- pod yaml for pod using pvc:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mongodb 
spec:
  containers:
  - image: mongo
    name: mongodb
    volumeMounts:
    - name: mongodb-data
      mountPath: /data/db
    ports:
    - containerPort: 27017
      protocol: TCP
  volumes:
  - name: mongodb-data
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: mongodb-pvc
```
- can delete pod and pvc
    - then pv status is `released`
        - bc set persistent volume to retain the volume in the persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: `retain`
            - `retain`: keep data within the volume
            - `recycle`: delete contents to be reused for new pvc
            - `delete`: delete underlying storage
