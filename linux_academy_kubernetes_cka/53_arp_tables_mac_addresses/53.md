## ARP
- address resource protocol
- used to turn IP address into MAC address when you ping an IP address on local network
- `arp` - shows current mappings the machine knows about
    - shows table with headers: `Address`...`HWAddress`...`Iface`
        - `Address` is ip address
        - `HWAddress` is hardware address, is `MAC address`
        - `Iface` interface to use to contact address - eg S3 interface, S3 interface etc
- ARP is local to LAN
- if you ping a machine on same subnet, the ping will result in a new record to the ARP table
- if you ping a machine on a different subnet, it won't be added
    - here client still needs to talk to router
        - router IP/Mac address should already be registered

## ARP table
- address resource protocol table
- map IP address to MAC address

## MAC address
- media access control 
- unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller
- used as a network address for communicating within a network segment

1. send packet in local network to IP 1.2.3.4
2. system looks at ARP table for 1.2.3.4:<mac_address>
    - if value is cached here, no need to use ARP
3. not found in ARP table? send a broadcast packet to network using `ARP protocol`
    - asking "who has 1.2.3.4"
    - this is sent to a special MAC address that causes all machines on network to receive it
4. any machine with requested IP address will reply withan ARP packet saying "I am 1.2.3.4"
    - this packet includes the mac address which can receive packets for that IP
