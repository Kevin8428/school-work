# Cluster Networking
- networking configs required on master/worker
- cluster has master/worker
- each `node` has at least 1 `interface` connected to a network
- each `interface` must have an `address` configured
- the host must have a unique `hostname` set and unique `MAC address`

- master should accept connections on `6443` for `api-server`
- worker nodes, kubectl, external users, etc - access api-server thru this port
- `kubelets` on master/worker listen on `10250`
- kube scheduler requires `10251`
- kube controller-manager requires `10252`
- worker nodes expose services for external access from `30000 - 32767`
- `etcd` listens on `2379`

# if multiple master nodes
- all master node ports must be open on all masters
- ADDITIONALLY - need port `2380` for etcd clients to talk to each other

# summary
- `10252` - controller-manager
- `6443`  - api-server
- `10251` - scheduler
- `2379`  - etcd
- `10250` - kubelets on master/worker
- `30000 - 32767` - worker nodes exposing services 

# CNI
- need to run script very time a container is created, to connect container to network
- CNI runs this script on startup of a container
- says: `this is how you should call a script ever time a container is created`

CNI file spec:
- ADD section
- DELETE section
```
ADD)
ip -n <namespace> link set...
DEL)
ip link del...
```

- kubelet on each node is responsible for creating a container
- kubelet looks at CNI configuration
    - id script name
    - look in /etc/cni/bin for script
    - execute with `./script.sh add <container> <namespace>`

# CNI plugin
-  invoked by node kubelet
eg `kubelet.service` contains these lines:
```
--network-plugin=cni
--cni-bin-dir=/opt/cni/bin
--cni-conf-dir=/etc/cni/net.d
```
