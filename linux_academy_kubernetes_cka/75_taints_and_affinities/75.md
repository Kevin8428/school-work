# taint/toleration
- tains on nodes
- tolerations on pods
- pods have no tolerations by default
- if you taint a node, no pods will go to it by default
- `taint=blue` - Node 1
- `taint=blue` 
- taints don't force pod onto node, just excludes some pods
- to force a pod onto a given node, you need to use `node selector` or `affinity`
- `master` has taint to stop `scheduler` from placing pods on the master node: `node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule`

## taing-effect
- what would happen to pods that don't tolearte a taint
    - `noschedule` - don't put on node
    - `preferNoschedule` - try not to place on node, but not guarantee
    - `noExecute` - don't put on node, and remove existing
- `kubectl taint node node1 color=blue:NoSchedule`

# node selector
- specify which node to place a pod
- have limitations 
    - can't specify `OR` or `NOT`
        - eg can't say "don't place on `size:small`
    - need `affinity`
```
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    size: Large
```
- `size:Large` is a label on the desired node

# Affinity
- ensure pods are on correct nodes
