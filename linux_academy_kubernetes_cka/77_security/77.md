# Security primitives
- `authentication` - defines who can access cluster
- `authorization` - defines what they can do 
    - implemented with `RBAC`
- `tls encryption` - used for all communication between components talking to api-server
- `network policies` - used for all pods talking to each other

# Authentication
- access to cluster
- end users (customers) security hitting apps, is managed by apps internally
- `humans` (devs/admin) and `service accounts` (bots)

## service accounts
- kubernetes lets you create/view service accounts with kubectl

## humans
- kuberentes doesn't manage human authentication
    - you can't create/view users w/ kubectl
- use external source like files w/ user creds, certs, or LDAP

- all user access managed by api server, which:
1. authenticate
2. process

### authenticate
options:
1. static password file
2. static token file
3. certs
4. LDAP - some third party

#### static files
- not recommended. should use volume mounts to provide auth file. Should use RBAC for new users.
1. create list of users/pw's in CSV file
- 3 colums:
    1. pw
    2. username
    3. uid
2. pass to api-server as option:
- inside `/usr/local/bin/kube-apiserver.service`
`--basic-auth-file=user-details.csv`
3. restart server/pod
4. use:
    - `curl -v -k https://master-node-id:6443/api/v1/pods -u "username:password"`

OPTIONS:
- `group` - can add fourth column to CSV file 
- `token` - can use token instead of pw in CSV file
    - use:
        - `curl -v -k https://master-node-id:6443/api/v1/pods --header "Authorization: Bearer abc123"`

# TLS
`server certificates` - public/private keys on server to secure connectivity
`root certificates` - public/private keys on CA
`client certificates` - public/privagte keys on user, verify user to server

CERTIFICATE IS ANOTHER WORD FOR PUBLIC KEY

public key:
`*.crt`
`*.pem`

private key:
`*.key`
`*-key.pem`
- typically have `key` in name somewhere

## outline
required:
- `server certificates` - for all server communication
- `client certificates` - for all clients
- `root certificates` - for all

- server/client both need to validate certs from each other
- to do this, everyone needs the CA root certificate (public key)
    - in things like webapp, this gets installed in users browser


### server components and certs - these need server certificates
- when someone hits server

- `api-server`
- need certs to secure communication with this server

- `etcd-server`
- need certs to secure communication with this server

- `kubelet-server`
- need cert to have api-server talk w/

### client components and certs - these need client certificates
- when hitting a server

- `admin`
- use kubectl to hit api-server

- `scheduler`
- use API to hit api-server to schedule pods

- `controller-manager`
- use API to hit api-server

- `kube-proxy`
- use API to hit api-server

- `api-server`
- talks to `kubelet` on each node - this is how it monitors worker nodes
- talks to `etcd` as a client
- for either, api-server can use same server certificates, or generate new ones

- `kubelet`
- use API to hit api-server. Probaby can use same server-certificate

## generate certificates
- `openssl` etc are good for making certs

### create CA cert
1. use openssl to generate keys `openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048`
2. generate certificate signing request `openssl req -new -key ca.key -subj "/CN=KUBERNETES-C" -out ca.csr`
- like a cert w/ details, but no signature
- CN == common name
3. sign cert `openssl x509 -req -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -out ca.crt`
NOTE:
- now we have `private key` and `root-certificate` file
- this is self signed usinig own private key generated in first step
- will use this CA key/pair for all other certificates going forward

### create client cert

#### admin user
- this if this like creating a new user
- will use CA key/pair to generate this
- `admin.key` is like the password
- `admin.crt` is like the user id - user id here has been validated and is trusted

1. create private key `openssl genrsa -out admin.key 2048`
2. generate CSR `openssl req -new -key admin.key -sub "/CN=kube-admin" -out admin.csr`
    - `CN` is name `kubectl` authenticates with
    - `CN` could be anything
    - this name will be shown in audit logs
3. generate signed certificate `openssl x509 -req -in admin.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -out admin.crt`
    - sign this certificate with previously creaated CA `certificate` and `key`

we need to identify the admin account and differentiate from just another basic user
- do this w/ group details in certificate
- `systems-masters` - group name in kubernetes
- `openssl req -new -key admin.key -sub "/CN=kube-admin/O=system:master -out admin.csr"`
    - this specifies the group. Needs to be done when generating the csr

#### Scheduler, Controller-Manager, Kube-Proxy - client certificates
- these are `system components` in control-plane
- these need to have name prefix with `system` eg `system-kube-scheduler.crt`

## using certificates
options:
1. now you can do `curl` and use cert instead of username:password
    - `curl https://master-node-id:6443/api/v1/pods --key admin.key --cert admin.crt --cacert ca.crt`
2. move all configs into kube-config.yaml file

- remember everyone needs CA root certificate
