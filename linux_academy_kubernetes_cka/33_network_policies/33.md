# network policies
- govern how pods communicate with each other
- by default, pods are open and can be accessed by anyone
    - therefore need to lock down pods, and ensure only services/pods that need access, get access
- use pod-label-selector or namespace-label-selector
- sets who can access by setting `ingress rules`
- sets which destination can be accessed using `egress rules`
- can specify `CIDR block range` of ip addresses, which network policy can apply to

- install plugin: `canal`
    - `wget -O canal.yaml https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.5/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/canal/canal.yaml`
    - `kubectl apply -f canal.yaml`

- pods enable communication by default. change to deny by default
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```
- blank podSelector
    - specify that all pods in namepsace inherit network policy
1. create network policy ^
2. test by creating deployment:
    - `kubectl run nginx --image=name --replicas=2`
3. expose deployment to create a service:
    - `kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80`
4. access using pod
    - `kubectl run busybox --rm -it --image=busybox /bin/sh`
        - `rm` - remove once done
        - `it` - keep session open
5. inside container, access service
    - `#wget --spider --timeout=1 nginx`
        - `spider` - just want to look at pages, don't download
6. see that you can't get to pod by default - success

- now open communication from pod-to-pod
- if only need 1 pod to reach out to another
    - web server to db server
    - need to specify ingress in network policy for the pod
- network yaml for policy:
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-netpolicy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: db
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: web
    ports:
    - port: 5432
```
- using podSelector.matchLabels `app: db` 
    - this policy will apply to all pods that have this label
    - these pods will only accept from pods that have `app:web`, as defined in ingress
    - can only communicate over port 5432

# create policy with namespace selector (versus pod selector)
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: ns-netpolicy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: db
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          tenant: web
    ports:
    - port: 5432
```
- same selector for which to apply to
- different for ingress (who can talk to these pods)

# create policy with IP range for selector
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: ipblock-netpolicy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: db
  ingress:
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 192.168.1.0/24
```
- within cidr range, all 254 addresses will be able to communicate with DB
- `kubectl get netpol`
    - short for `kubectl get networkpolicies`

# create egress policy
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: egress-netpol
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: db
    ports:
    - port: 5432
```
- for pods with label `app:web`, only allow them to talk to pods labled `app:db`
