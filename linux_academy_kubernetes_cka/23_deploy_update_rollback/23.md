# deploy an application, rolling updates, and rollbacks
- deploy w/ Deployment

# Deployment
- high level resource for deploying/updating
- `kubectl create -f deployment.yaml --record`
    - `--record` - record command in revision history
- `kubectl rollout status deployments <name>`
- `kubectl get pods`
    - name has suffix random string of numbers
    - name suffix is generated w/ hashed value of pod template/deployment
- `kubectl get replicasets`
    - name contains hashed value of pod
- `kubectl scale deployment <name> --replicas=5 `
    - scale up to 5
- want to update app for new features?
    - update app w/o shutting down
    - `minReadySeconds`
- `kubectl replace -f deployment.yaml`
    - replace old w/ new. If not previously existing, won't deploy.

## rolling update
- prefered
1. create new replicaSet, spin up pods in new set
2. as new are spun up, terminate pods in old ReplicaSet

# update and roll back
1. deploy updated image
2. `kubectl rollout undo deployments <name>` - roll back
    - deployments keep revision history, stored in underlying ReplicaSets
- `kubectl rollout history deployment <name>` - see rollout history
    - see CHANG-CAUSE
        - this is populated because of `--record` when creating deployment

- `kubectl rollout pause deployment <name>`
    - create single pod, but not all of them
    - all old pods still run
    - good for canary release
- `kubectl rollout resume deployment <name>`
    - do full rollout
