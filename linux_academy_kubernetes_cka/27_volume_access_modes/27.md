```
- persistent volume resource requires specifying `access mode`

# access mode
- when creating a pv, need to specify if volume can be read/written to/from by a single node or multiple nodes at same time
```
- ReadWriteOnce - only single node can mount volume for write/read
- ReadOnlyMany - multiple nodes can mount volume for read
- ReadWriteMany - many nodes can mount volume for read/write
```
- ^ this is the mount capability of the node, not the pod
- volume can only be mounted using one access mode at a time
    - this spec can be mounted as ReadWriteOnce, and later ReadWriteMany, but not both at same time
