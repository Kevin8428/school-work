# scheduler
1. `nodeName`
    - not set typically 
    - scheduler goes thru all pods and looks for ones that don't have this set
        - these are candidates for scheduling
2. scheduler ID's correct node by running algorithm
3. schedules by setting `nodeName` property to name of node

- `pending` - state for pods if no scheduler
    - can manually assign yourself by setting `nodeName` to that of node
- can't modify nodeName of existing pod
