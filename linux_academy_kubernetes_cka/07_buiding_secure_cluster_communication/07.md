# Secure cluster communications

`plugins` ????????
`service-account` ????????

- set all communications to HTTPS

- `kubectl` - command is translator to k8s api-server
    - server provides CRUD interface for querying/modifying cluster state over RESTful API
    - creating a pod does POST to api-server, goes thru `authentication`, `authorization`, `admission` and validation
        - then state is stored in `etcd`
    - `authentication`
        - api-server calls plugins until one determines who is sending request
        - method can be determined using HTTP header or certificate
        - once found, request returns username, user-id and groups user belongs to
        - for now passed with `self-signed certificate`
            - can view in .kube/config file
                - has certificate authority, masters-server address, cluster, client certificate, and client key
    - `authorization`
        - determine whether user can perform requested action on resource 
            - eg can user create a pod in this namespace?
    - `admission`
        - CUD - must hit admission-control
        - R - read, no need need for amission, it's skipped
        - go thru all plugins, allowing them to modify resource for different reasons
            - eg service-accont plugin applies default-service account to pods that don't explicitly specify it
            - then api-server validates the object and stores it in etcd and returns a response


## client and pod requests
- all requests come from 2 sources: a `pod` or a `client` 
        - `client` is a user - this is performed with `kubectl` command
- all requests go thru authentcation/authorization/admission

### client
- requests from users, `RBAC` (`role-based-access-control`) is used to prevent unauthorized users from changing cluster state
- user can be associated with 1 or more roles, each role can perform an action on certain resources
    - eg `create` is an action and `pod` is a resource
- manage RBAC by creating 4 resources in 2 groups: 
    1. `roles` and `role-bindings` 
        - namespace resources
    2. `cluster-roles` and `cluster-role-bindings`
        - cluster-level resources
    - `role` - what can be done
    - `binding` - who can do it

### pod
- `service-account` is created for pod - get more info on what this is???????????
    - represents identity of the app running in the pod
    - `token-file` holds service-accounts authentication token
        - can view token file inside pod `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`
        - app uses token to communicate with api-server
            - plugin authenticates service-account and passes the service-accounts username back to api-server core
    - if not specified, default service-account is applied
    - can only use service-account from same namespace
        - pod in one namespace cannot reach out to service account in another namespace
