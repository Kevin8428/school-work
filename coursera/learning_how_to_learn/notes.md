# chunking
- get initial sense of pattern you want to master
    - grasp smaller bits - neural mini-chunks. Later these are joined to larger chunks
    - guitar: listen/watch, then learn some cords
    - golf: learn specific techniques one by one
    - goal: want things to become muscle memory

- when first starting new problem, have heavy congnitive load
- helps to have working example to walk thru

`if you're stuck learning something, move in. You can learn big picture and other pieces of context around the area you're stuck on. This will likely help get you unstuck. `

1. focus individed attention
2. understand basic concept
- get broad scope of what your learning and how it ties to big picture
3. get context
- when to use
- repeat/practice
- practice broadens neurons to chunk and is therefore firmed/accessible

need to know:
1. how it works
2. when to use it
3. how it ties into other related topics/chunks

# recall
1. read
2. close book and recite
3. re-read

# illusion of completeness
- need info to persiste, can't just read/highlight
- test yourself (recall does this). Mistakes are good, makes repairs in thinking
- learning in same room can result in triggers of memory - best to study in more than one place

# mini-testing

# value of making mistakes
